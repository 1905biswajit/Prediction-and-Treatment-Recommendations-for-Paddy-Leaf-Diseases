# Prediction and Treatment Recommendations for Paddy Leaf Diseases using Deep Learning and Ensemble-Based Classification Approaches

## Abstract
Paddy cultivation plays a crucial role in global food security, yet its productivity is often threatened by various leaf diseases. Early detection and proper treatment recommendations can significantly improve yield and minimize crop loss.  

This research presents a **deep learning-based approach** for predicting **paddy leaf stage** and **disease classification** to provide targeted treatment recommendations.  

- A **basic neural network** was trained on a paddy leaf stage dataset to determine the growth stage.  
- Multiple deep learning models (**CNN, VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and MobileNetV2**) were fine-tuned and ensembled using an **average voting technique** for accurate disease classification.  
- The **ensemble model** outperformed individual models, achieving a prediction accuracy of **98.99%**.  
- After identifying both the leaf stage and disease, a **Streamlit-based web application** was developed to provide farmers with treatment recommendations based on the predicted results.  

This system offers an **automated, accessible, and user-friendly solution** for paddy farmers, integrating deep learning and web-based technologies to support informed decision-making in disease management. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, achieving high classification accuracy and proving its potential for **real-world agricultural applications**.
